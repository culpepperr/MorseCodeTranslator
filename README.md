# MorseCodeTranslator

#Copied from Devpost submission
## Inspiration
I saw the challenge on the LHD challenges page and thought it would be a fun one to accomplish
## What it does
Translates dashes and dots to alpha/numeric message
## How we built it
Using python and reges on replit I wrote a program to translate morse code
## Challenges we ran into
Currently only reads one way. Was challening to set up the programs to accept "dot"/"dash" and "."/"-"
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
It works in less than 2 hours!
## What we learned
Mostly how fun coding can be
## What's next for Morse Code Translator
Will improve usability/flexibility. More debugging. Allow for translation either way. Possibly more allowed input formats. Currently only runs in shell, may change to other later.
